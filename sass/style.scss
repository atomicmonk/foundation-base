Theme Name: Foundation Base for Thematic
Theme URI: http://tehnokratt.net/found-o-matic/
Description: A child theme for Thematic based on Foundation 3 framework by ZURB and Responsive Base by Scott Nix. Works rather nicely with Theme Unit Test but needs some tuning + support for Orbit and Reveal modules. Main menu is supported with 1 sub-level (Foundation limit).
