Theme Name: Foundation Base for Thematic
Theme URI: https://github.com/petskratt/foundation-base/
Description: A child theme for Thematic based on Foundation 3.0.9 framework by ZURB and Responsive Base by Scott Nix. Works rather nicely with Theme Unit Test but needs some tuning + support for Orbit and Reveal modules. Main menu is supported with 1 sub-level (Foundation limit).
