Foundation Base, child theme for the Thematic
===============

Integrating Thematic, Foundation (by Zurb) and Responsive Base (by Scott Nix) to enable easy path from prototyping to fully functional Wordpress site.

(and learning git at the same time)

Installation:

* install Thematic theme framework from http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic
* download & unzip Foundation Base into /wp-content/themes
* activate Foundation Base
* enjoy, with attitude

Features:

* using semantic mixins with Thematic IDs
* everything done in SASS
* usually updated to latest Foundation version within a week of release
* javascripts nicely joined and minified with @codekit-append's
* NextGEN gallery integration with Orbit (use template=orbit)
* now supporting also wp_page_menu (if custom menu is not defined builds nav-bar from page hierarchy)
* ... and a Foundation sidenav widget that creates nav-bar vertical, listing pages from current page's topmost ancestor (unless on home page)
